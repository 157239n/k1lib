k1lib.k1ui module
--------------------

`k1ui <https://github.com/157239n/k1ui>`_ is another project made in Java that
aims to record and manipulate the screen, keyboard and mouse. The interface to
that project on its own is clunky, and this module is the Python interface to
ease its use.

Not quite developed yet tho, because I'm lazy.

.. automodule:: k1lib.k1ui
