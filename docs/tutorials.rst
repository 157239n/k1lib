Tutorials
=========

Not a lot at the moment:

- `basics <tutorials/basics.html>`_: Go over the basics of the main DL framework
- `cli <tutorials/cli.html>`_: Go over the :mod:`k1lib.bioinfo.cli` module
- `covid <tutorials/covid.html>`_: Analyze covid's genome using the :mod:`k1lib.bioinfo.cli` module

Also note that all tutorials are versioned, and they will change if features in
previous versions got removed and whatnot.
