PyTorch is awesome, and it provides a very effective way to execute ML code fast. What it lacks is surrounding infrastructure to make general debugging and discovery process better. Other more official wrapper frameworks sort of don't make sense to me, so this is an attempt at recreating a robust suite of tools that makes sense.

Check over the docs at [k1lib.github.io](https://k1lib.github.io), and these tutorials:
